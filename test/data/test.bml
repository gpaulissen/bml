* The 1!c opening

  Opening 1!c shows at least 16+ hcp, and is forcing. The
  continuation is fairly natural.

  Some hands might be upgraded to 1!c due to distribution, but
  wildly distributional hands might also be downgraded to avoid
  problems if the opponents preempt.

** The 1!d negative

   Responding 1!d shows a hand which doesn't have enough values to
   establish a game force.
