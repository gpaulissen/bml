#ENDCUT

  We start by cutting our NT-module, since this will be used on all
  NT-openings. =#CUT= is similar to the =#COPY= command, but using =#CUT=
  means that it isn't parsed as a bidding table until it is pasted.
  
#VUL N0

  The =#VUL= command is used to set the vulnerability. It takes an
  argument of two characters, each can be Y, N or 0. The first
  character asks if we are vulnerable and the second asks if our
  opponents are vulnerable. Y is for Yes, N is for No and 0 means that
  it doesn't matter.
  
#SEAT 12

  The =#SEAT= command sets the seat in which the bid should be valid. 0
  means that the seat doesn't matter (all seats), 12 means first or
  second and 34 means third or fourth. 1--4 could also be used.
  
#HIDE
1N 12--14
  #PASTE nt_module

  So when we're not vulnerable we open 1NT 12--14 in 1st and 2nd seat.
  
#SEAT 34
  
#HIDE
1N 14--16
  #PASTE nt_module

  But in third and fourth seat it is 14--16.
  
#VUL Y0
  
#SEAT 0
  
#HIDE
1N 14--16
  #PASTE nt_module

  When we're vulnerable we always open 1NT 14--16.
