Defensive Carding Record

Comment
-------
There should never be a need to edit or generate this record other than by
using the Full Disclosure editor.

Format
------
% <Leads vs NT> <Leads vs Suits> <Defensive Signals> [<Description and Other agreements>]

Description
-----------
This record represents your carding agreements and, if there is one, is the
last record in the file.

Leads vs NT
-----------
There are 22 characters in this string, each representing one of the card
combinations listed in the Leads vs NT section of the Full Disclosure editor’s
Opening Leads section.

The choices you can make in the editor do not always include every card in the
combination; for example, you cannot choose to lead the Queen from Qxx. Of the
available choices, 'B' indicates the top card, 'C' the next lower card, and so
on.

Here is the full list of 22 card combinations:

xx, xxx, xxxx, xxxxx, Qxx, Qxxx, Qxxxx, Qxxxxx, Qxxxxxx, AKx, KQJ, QJ10, J109, 1098, KQ109, AKJ10, AQJ, AJ10, A109, KJ10, K109, Q109

Leads vs Suits
--------------
There are 18 characters in this string, each representing one of the card
combinations listed in the Leads vs Suits section of the Full Disclosure
editor’s Opening Leads section.

The encoding is exactly the same as described above.

Here is the full list of 18 card combinations:

xx, xxx, xxxx, xxxxx, Qxx, Qxxx, Qxxxx, Qxxxxx, Qxxxxxx, AK, AKx, KQJ, QJ10, J109, 1098, KJ10, K109, Q109

Defensive Signals
-----------------
In the Full Disclosure editor section on Defensive Signals, there are three
sections for signals against notrump contract and three for suit
contracts. Each of those has an agreement for first, second, and third
priority.

Thus the following six sections each have a first, second, and third priority for a total of 18 characters in the Defensive Carding record:

Partner leads vs NT
Declarer leads vs NT
Discards vs NT
Partner leads vs suit
Declarer leads vs suit
Discards vs suit

The choice of agreements listed in the Full Disclosure editor is the same for each of the 18 situations. The encoding is:

A : No agreement
B : Attitude (Hi=Enc.)
C : Attitude (Hi=Disc.)
D : Attitude (Odd=Enc.)
E : Attitude (Odd=Disc.)
F : Count (Hi=Even)
G : Count (Hi=Odd)
H : Count (Odd/Even)
I : Suit Preference (Hi-Hi)
J : Suit Preference (Hi-Low)
K : Other

Bidding Sequence

Format
------
  AB <Bidding Sequence> = CDEFGHI J [KL] [<Description>]
* AB <Bidding Sequence> = CDEFGHI J [KL] [<Description>]

Records that start with an asterisk represent competitive sequences where They
open; those without the asterisk represent sequences where We open.

The capital letters, except in the name of character strings, represent
encodings : each is a single character representing some information.

Position
--------
'A' represents the position in which the opening bid is made. Implicitly this
defines the Dealer, which is the label used in the Full Disclosure editor when
defining the bid.

The encoding is:

0 : Any position
1 : 1st position
2 : 2nd position
3 : 3rd position
4 : 4th position
5 : 1st or 2nd position
6 : 3rd or 4th position.

Vulnerability
-------------
'B' represents the prevailing vulnerability conditions which apply to the bidding sequence.

In the following list of encodings, the labels used in the Full Disclosure
editor are included in parentheses.

0 : Any conditions (Any)
1 : Nobody vulnerable (None vul)
2 : We are vulnerable; they are not (Only we vul)
3 : We are not vulnerable; they are (Only they vul)
4 : Both sides are vulnerable (Both vul)
5 : We are not vulnerable; they may or may not be (We not vul)
6 : We are vulnerable; they may or may not be (We vul)
7 : We may or may not be vulnerable; they are not (They not vul)
8 : We may or may not be vulnerable; they are (They vul)

Bidding Sequence
----------------
The Bidding Sequence starts immediately after the first two characters and is
terminated by the equals sign ('='). The calls in the sequence are either 'P'
for Pass, 'D' for Double, 'R' for Redouble, or a bid. A bid consists of a
single digit ('1' to '7') followed by the initial letter of the strain ('S',
'H', 'D', 'C', or 'N' for notrump).

Note: If a Qualification is entered for an opponent’s bid, then that
qualification will appear as a string within braces (curly brackets). It will
appear after the bid that was qualified and after the intervention. The
qualified bid does not have to be the first one in the sequence; for example,
you might play one agreement over an opponent’s transfer bid, but another if
their suit responses to 1NT are natural.

Artificial Bid
--------------
'C' is used to indicate whether the last bid in the sequence is artificial ('Y') or not ('N').

Possible Outcomes
-----------------
The next six characters ('D' through 'I') represent the six possible
outcomes. If the outcome is possible, it is a 'Y'; otherwise an 'N'. The
outcomes (possible strains that are still open after the last bid in the
sequence) are, in order:

D : Clubs
E : Diamonds
F : Hearts
G : Spades
H : Notrump
I : Defend undoubled

Disposition
-----------
'J' encodes the Disposition of the last bid in the sequence as defined in Full Disclosure.

The encoding is:

0 : no agreement
1 : Signoff
2 : Non-forcing
3 : Constructive
4 : Invitational
5 : Forcing
6 : Forcing to game
7 : Slam try
8 : Control bid
9 : Preemptive
A : Transfer
B : Puppet
C : Relay
D : Asking bid
E : Asking bid response

Suit Length
-----------
The minimum and maximum promised suit length that apply to the last bid in the bidding sequence are defined by 'K' and 'L' respectively.

If the last bid is a notrump bid, then 'K' and 'L' are omitted.

The digits '0' to '8' are used to represent the actual length for the minimum length ('K').

In the case of the maximum length ('L'), the digits '0' to '7' are used to represent the actual length, and '8' to represent 'Any'.

Description
-----------
The Description string is whatever you entered under Description when you defined the last bid in the bidding sequence.
