# BML

This project defines a Bridge Markup Language that can be used to describe a
bridge system in text format. The advantage is that you can store it in a
source code repository like GitHub and thus easily can see the differences
between versions. Plus it is much quicker to write with a text editor than a
WYSIWYG editor, in my humble opinion.

See also the [README.org](README.org). This is a text file that can be read in
a browser. But the best way to read it is in the Emacs editor with [Emacs Org
mode](https://orgmode.org/).
